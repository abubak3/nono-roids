## Build

## Instructions to play

## Ideas

Basic idea - Nonogram game in center. Asteroids coming at it need to be clicked to be destroyed. 3 lives. Easy Medium and Difficult - harder nonograms, more asteroids.

## To Do

- Home Page and Game play Page?
  - Home
    - Top Menu Bar to select Difficulty
    - Logo in the middle? Pretty rotating planet maybe?
    - intructions at bottom
  - Game Page
    - Canvas on whole page. spot in center for the grid? (Like the Fruit Smash Game)
    - Game name in top left corner
    - lives in top right corner
    - at bottom of page select the X or Check for the nonogram
    - asteroid objects flying on page
- Preload
  - Hard Coded Nonogram Grids (maybe like 10 of each level?)
  - Upload images for asteroids and hearts
- Win / Lose
  - Win when nonogram is finished
  - Lose when lives = 0 (lose a life everytime an asteroid hits the board)
  - Clear page and have animations? confetti or red screen of death
  - Send back to home page
- Implementing Things
  - Nonogram Part
    - Load in grid
