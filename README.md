## Build

## Instructions to play

## Ideas

Basic idea - Nonogram game in center. Asteroids coming at it need to be clicked to be destroyed. 3 lives. Easy Medium and Difficult - harder nonograms, more asteroids.

## To Do

- Home Page and Game play Page?
  - Home
    - Top Menu Bar to select Difficulty                       - DONE
    - Logo in the middle? Pretty rotating planet maybe?       - DONE

    - lives in top right corner                                                 - EXISTS - NEEDS TO UPDATE ONCE WE ADD ASTEROID FUNCTIONALITY
    - at bottom of page select the X or Check for the nonogram                  - FIXED TO BE RIGHT AND LEFT CLICKING
    - asteroid objects flying on page                                           - NOT DONE YET

  - Upload images for asteroids and hearts                                        - UPLOADED ASTEROID PICS - NOT DOING HEARTS?
- Win / Lose
  - Win when nonogram is finished                                           - WIN WORKS - NEED TO DO LOSE
